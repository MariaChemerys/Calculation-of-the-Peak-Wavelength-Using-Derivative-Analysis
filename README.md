<h1 align="center">Calculation of the Peak Wavelength Using Derivative Analysis</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
This project is an algorithm that I designed to compute the peak wavelength of the blackbody radiation spectrum. <br>
A blackbody is an idealized object that absorbs all incoming electromagnetic radiation. Blackbodies are used by astronomers to model the radiation emitted by stars and planets. Using the blackbody radiation spectrum, the temperatures and properties of these celestial objects can be estimated. By employing Planck's radiation law, this spectrum can be described mathematically. <br>
<b>Planck's Law</b> relates the spectral radiance of a black body (an idealized object that absorbs all incoming electromagnetic radiation) to its temperature and wavelength:

Where:<br>
• B is the spectral radiance in watts per square meter per steradian per meter (W⁻²sr⁻¹m⁻¹)<br>
• λ is the wavelength in metres (m)<br>
• T is the temperature in kelvins (K)<br>
• h is Planck's constant in joule-seconds (6.626 ⋅ 10⁻³⁴ Js)<br>
• c is the speed of light in a vacuum in metres per second (3.0 ⋅ 10⁸ ms⁻¹)<br>
• k is the Boltzmann constant in joules per kelvin (1.381 ⋅ 10⁻²³ JK⁻¹)<br>
